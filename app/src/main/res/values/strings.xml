    <string name="rules1">The rules are simple: the orcs fight against the dwarves. Each part starts with 10.000 resources, which they can use to attack the other side and causing as much damage as they can. Each action costs resources from both sides, depending of the strength and the final outcome of the action. By default actions cost 30 (Kill a chieftan/Butch a thane), 20 (Persecute raiders / Raze a village) or 10 (Slay grunts / Murder peons) resources, but that gets multiplied by a value depending on the attack and defense roll. Both sides lose resources, but the attacker - if won - gets honor points, also depending on the action it successfully performed (3 points for Kill a chieftan/Butch a thane, 2 points for Persecute raiders / Raze a village and 1 point for Slay grunts / Murder peons).</string>
    <string name="rules2">If one side is getting low on resources, it can still decide to Gather resources / Extrude resources, which will grant them a small amount of usable resources to continue the war. If the resource on either side drops below 0, the war ends and the one, with the higher Honor points win.</string>
    <string name="rules3">The Peace treaty stops the war, restore the resources and clear all the honor points.</string>
